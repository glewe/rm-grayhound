A non-intrusive grayish [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/) skin showing system resource usage.

## Introduction
I know Rainmeter for many years now. I love it and always liked playing around with the endless skinning possibilities. "Enigma" is one of my favorite skins and in 2012 I found some excellent skin work by [BlaCkOuT1911](http://blackout1911.deviantart.com/) and [Frosch99](http://frosch99.deviantart.com/) that works well with Enigma. That motivated me to create "Grayhound".

I like less obstrusive skins for metering so I decided to go "gray scale" for all the frame work plus some pastell colors for the values. Using a wide screen monitor, my approach was to only place the meters on the far left and right of the desktop so that I can use my application windows in the center and still have a glimpse on the system usage.

## Note
For the Fan Speed and Temperature skin you need to install [HWiNFO](https://www.hwinfo.com/) that delivers the corresponding readings to Rainmeter.
You might to need to edit the skin file @Resources/HWiNFO.inc to adjust the Sensor IDs to your system. See the documentation for details.

For the Music Skin you need one of the supported media players that Rainmeter can read from. You can find the supported players listed [here](https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual/measures/nowplaying/).
