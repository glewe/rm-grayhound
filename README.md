A non-intrusive grayish [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/) skin showing system resource usage.

## Introduction

I know Rainmeter for many years now. I love it and always liked playing around with the endless skinning possibilities. "Enigma" is one of my favorite skins and in 2012 I found some excellent skin work by [BlaCkOuT1911](http://blackout1911.deviantart.com/) and [Frosch99](http://frosch99.deviantart.com/) that works well with Enigma. That motivated me to create "Grayhound".

I like less obstrusive skins for metering so I decided to go "gray scale" for all the frame work plus some pastell colors for the values. Using a wide screen monitor, my approach was to only place the meters on the far left and right of the desktop so that I can use my application windows in the center and still have a glimpse on the system usage.

## Note

For the Fan Speed and Temperature skin you need to install [HWiNFO 7.x](https://www.hwinfo.com/) that delivers the corresponding readings to the Registry where Rainmeter Measures can pick them up.
Read more about the setup of HWiNFO and Rainmeter here: [https://docs.rainmeter.net/tips/hwinfo/](https://docs.rainmeter.net/tips/hwinfo/)

For the Music Skin you need one of the supported media players that Rainmeter can read from. You can find the supported players listed [here](https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual/measures/nowplaying/).
